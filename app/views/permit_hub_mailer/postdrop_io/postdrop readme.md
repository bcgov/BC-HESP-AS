Postdrop.io is the tool used for creating rich emails that render properly across all devices and screen sizes. It handles the processing and rendering of the HTML & CSS and outputs the raw html (that includes all the inline css to format the email).

- Folder "email content preprocess" contains all the pre-processed html versions of the content before its processed into "raw html for email".
- "postdrop template css.txt" is for CSS styling classes used specifically in the emails
- "postdrop template generic html.txt" is the a generic template from which you can use as a baseline to create new email teemplates.
