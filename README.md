# Overview

Welcome to the codebase for BC's Housing Permit Portal

## Getting Started

The codebase uses Rails on the back-end, and React/MST stack on the front-end.

Ensure you have the following:

- Ruby 3.2.2
- Postgres 13+
- Redis
- Node 20.10+

### Local Running Steps

- Install Dependencies: `bundle install` and `npm install`
- Ensure you have a `.env` file with required variables (reference `.env.example`)
- Set up Database credentials following [the official Rails guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v2.3/getting_started.html#configuring-a-database). One of the ways is to have an environment variable called `DATABASE_URL`
- (_Only first time_) Create a database: `rails db:create`
- (_Only first time or if there are changes_) Run migrations: `rails db:migrate`
- (_Only first time or if there are changes_) Generate seed data: `rails db:seed`
- Start the server: `rails s`
- Start the front-end dev server for hot-reloading: `npm run dev`

## Deployment (DevOps)
