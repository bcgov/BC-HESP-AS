  title: Integration API V1
  version: v1
  description: "### API documentation overview\nThis document provides detailed information
    about the APIs available for external integrators to query and retrieve submitted
    and resubmitted permit applications.\nIt also includes specifications on webhook
    events that notify your systems in real-time.\n\n### Data scope:\nThe permit applications
    returned by these APIs are limited to those within the jurisdiction associated
    with the API key used for the request. This\nensures that each integrator has
    access solely to relevant data.\n\n### Integration steps:\nTo integrate with our
    APIs, please contact the Building Permit Hub team to enable your API access. Your
    local jurisdiction can then obtain the API key\nand register your webhook URL
    in their configuration settings on the building permit hub. You can reach us directly
    at <digital.codes.permits@gov.bc.ca>\nfor further assistance.\n\n### Authentication
    and authorization:\nAccess to these APIs is controlled via an API key, which must
    be included in the Authorization header as a Bearer token like so:\n```\nAuthorization:
    Bearer {Your_API_Key_Here}\n```\nPlease note that a unique API key is required
    for each jurisdiction you wish to access, enhancing security and data integrity.\n\n###
    Rate limits:\nTo ensure fair usage, the API is rate-limited to 100 requests per
    minute per API key and 300 requests per IP in a 3 minute interval. Exceeding these\nlimits
    will result in a 429 response. If this occurs, we recommend spacing out your requests.
    Continued exceeding of rate limits\nmay necessitate further contact with the building
    permit hub team.\n\n### Api base path:\nThe base path for all API endpoints is
    `/external_api/v1`.\n\n### Server information for testing:\nBy default the requests
    from the documentation will be sent to the current environment servers. For testing
    purposes, you can specify a different server using the {serverUrl} variable.\nDuring
    your integration testing phase, you have the flexibility to use custom URLs by
    configuring the serverUrl variable. This allows you to\ntailor the API environment
    to better suit your development needs. Ensure that your custom URLs are configured
    correctly to avoid any connectivity or data access issues.\n\n### Special considerations:\nA
    returned permit application will have a status of either `newly_submitted` for
    permit applications submitted for the first time, or `resubmitted` for\npermit
    applications that have been resubmitted due to revision requests. The `resubmitted_at`
    field will indicate the timestamp of the latest resubmission.\nWhile there may
    be multiple resubmissions, the submission data payload returned will reflect the
    most recent submission data. \n\nFor security purposes, any API response that
    includes a file URL will have a signed URL. These files will be available for
    download for a limited time (1 hour).\nWe recommend downloading the file immediately
    upon receiving the URL to avoid any issues. If necessary, you can always call
    the API again to retrieve a\nnew file URL.\n\n### Visual aids and examples:\nFor
    a better understanding of how our APIs work, including webhook setups and request
    handling, please refer to the code examples included later\nin this document.\n"

          ### Request body:
          This webhook sends information about a recently submitted permit
                  application in a JSON format to the webhook URL specified by the external integrator.
          It includes
                  the permit application ID, which can be used to fetch the complete details of the permit application using the
                  `GET/permit_applications/{id}` endpoint.

          ### Retries:
          If the webhook does not receive a 200 status response
                  from the external integrator, it will attempt to resend the notification up to 8 times using an exponential backoff
                  strategy. This ensures multiple attempts to deliver the webhook in case of temporary issues on the receiving end.


          ### Expected responses:
          The external integrator is expected to return a 200 status code to confirm successful receipt
                  of the data. This acknowledgment indicates that the payload was received and processed without issues

          This webhook sends information about a recently resubmitted permit
